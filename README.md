# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project is part of a capstone exercise aimed at analyzing the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and employs various data science and visualization techniques.

## 🧪 Objective

To analyze COVID-19 data globally and derive insights such as:
- Total confirmed, recovered, and death cases over time
- Country-wise comparison
- Trend visualizations and forecasting (if applicable)

## ⚙️ Features

- Data loading and preprocessing with **Pandas**
- Summary statistics and aggregation
- Time series plotting using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Country-wise breakdown of cases
- Trend analysis over time

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📌 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip packages:
  ```
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
  ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Capstone Project_ - Problem for Covid - 19 Data Analysis.ipynb` and run all cells.

## 📂 Data Source

> *(Assumed)* The data used is from the **Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset** or a similar CSV file containing:
- Date
- Country/Region
- Province/State
- Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered counts

Make sure your dataset (e.g., `covid_19_data.csv`) is placed in the correct directory if not already included.

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- Line charts of confirmed vs deaths over time
- Bar charts comparing countries
- Daily case growth
